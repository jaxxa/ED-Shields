# ED-ShieldsBasic
A mod for the Game Rimworld


This mod allows you to place shield generators. They are expensive and power hungry but can really strengthen your defences. The standard shields will stop projectiles that try to enter it, but allow weapons to be fired out.

## Specifications

There are a number of different statistics that govern how Shield work.
Strength: How much Damage a shield can Take
Radius: How large the covered area is.
BlockIndirect: Can is Block Bullets and other directly fired Projectiles.
BlockDirect: Can it block Mortars and other Indirect Fire Weapons.
DropPods: Can is target Drop Pods, frying their navigation and causing them to crash.
